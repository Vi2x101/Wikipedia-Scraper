# Wikipedia-Scraper

This repository contains a Python script that will take a Wikipedia page URL as input and print out the page's sections, the frequent words within each section (excluding stop words), and the links contained each section. To access this code, you can find it in main.py (scroll all the way to the bottom of main.py and you can designate a URL to see  and test out how the script functions).

### What I Did

To give some idea as to how this script works, I had first compiled a list of stopwords from various libraries and combined them into a singular list of 411 stop words. The libraries that I ended up using to get these stop words include NLTK, Spacy, and Stop_Words.
